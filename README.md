# BookStore Assignment App

## Overview
This project is a practice bookstore application developed using Swift, adhering to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. This project is the same 
as previous bookstore app. This time I used SwiftUI for screen and others part for UIKit by learning Basic SwiftUI. It incorporates third-party libraries such as Alamofire for
networking, Kingfisher for image downloading and caching, KeychainAccess for storing credentials like token securely and Swift Package Manager for dependency manager.
